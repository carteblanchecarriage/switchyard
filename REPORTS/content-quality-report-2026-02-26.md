## 2. Placeholder/Content Gap Issues

### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

| File | Issue | Count |
|------|-------|-------|
| `best/index.html` | `[Image Placeholder]` in keyboard cards | 3 instances |

**Impact:** Visual appearance of "Best Keyboards" page is broken.

### Recommendation:
Replace placeholders with:
- Actual product images from data.json
- Unsplash keyboard photos
- Remove image divs until photos available

---

## 3. Product Description Quality

**Data Source:** `data.json` (919 products)

| Description Quality | Count | Percentage |
|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Good (100+ chars) | 809 | 88.0% ✅ |
| Short (<100 chars) | 110 | 12.0% ⚠️ |
| Missing (<20 chars) | 93 | 10.1% ⚠️ |

**Analysis:** The majority (88%) of products have adequate descriptions scraped from vendor sites. Short descriptions are typically from incomplete vendor data - acceptable for now.

---

## 4. Cross-Sell Opportunities Identified

### Current State
Each guide appropriately links to related content:
- ✅ Complete Guide → Browse keyboards CTA
- ✅ Beginner Guide → Links to all 4 sub-guides
- ✅ Switches Guide → Links to home/browse
- ✅ Programming Guide → Links to Switchyard homepage

### Missed Opportunities

| Source Page | Missing Cross-Sell |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `best/index.html` | No links to "How to Choose" guide |
| `faq/index.html` | No links to specific product recommendations |
| `guides/lubing/` | Could link to "Best Hot-swap Keyboards" |
| `guides/switches/` | Could link to "Best Programming Keyboards" |

**Recommendation:** Add context-aware cross-links in the footer of each guide to increase page engagement.
