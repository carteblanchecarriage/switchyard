|--------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Keychron** | ~1,550 | `?ref=switchyard` | 8% |
| **KBDfans** | ~946 | `?ref=switchyard` | 8% |

**Total Products with Affiliate URLs:** 3,546  
**Primary Tracking Parameter:** `?ref=switchyard` (In-house programs)  
**Tracking Code Consistency:** ✅ All using same ref parameter

---

## 2. MISSING TRACKING CODES ❌

### Amazon Associates — CRITICAL
- **Status:** NOT CONFIGURED
- **Impact:** All Amazon traffic generates **$0 revenue**
- **Evidence:** Amazon search links found in HTML content lack `tag=` parameter

**Example Untracked URLs Found:**
```
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hhkb+professional+hybrid
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=royal+kludge+rk61
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=glorious+gmmk+compact
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=akko+3068b+plus
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=durgod+hk+venus
```

**Files Affected:**
- `/best/index.html` (Amazon search links for 5+ products)

### Static Guide Pages — MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Root Cause:** Manual HTML pages don't pass through affiliate URLs
- **Pages Affected:**
  - `/best/index.html` - Uses relative "Check Current Price" buttons
  - `/beginner/index.html` - Uses relative links
  - `/guides/switches/index.html` - No direct affiliate links

---

## 3. BROKEN/MALFORMED LINKS ✅

**Status:** No broken links detected in primary data.

- All 3,546 affiliate URLs in data.json follow consistent `?ref=switchyard` pattern
- Guide pages use relative/internal navigation without external links
- No 404s or malformed URLs detected during scan

---

## 4. LINK OPPORTUNITIES 🎯

### High Priority (Revenue Impact)

| Opportunity | Platform | Commission | Action |
|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Amazon Associates** | Amazon | 1-4% | Apply at affiliate-program.amazon.com |
| **Glorious Gaming** | Impact | 5-10% | Apply at gloriousgaming.com/pages/affiliates |
| **CannonKeys** | In-house | 5-8% | Email support@cannonkeys.com |

### Medium Priority

| Vendor | Commission | Relevance |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **The Key Company** | 10% | Keycaps & switches focus |
| **DiviniKey** | ~5% | Entry/mid-range market |
| **Prevail Key Co** | ~5% | Stabilizers expertise |

### Lower Priority / Future

- **Boardsource** - DIY kits & Choc switches
- **Mekibo** - Import/enthusiast boards
- **Oblotzky Industries** - Premium/GMK focus

---

## 5. REVENUE POTENTIAL CALCULATION

### Current State
- **Active Programs:** 6 vendors
- **Commission Range:** 5-10%
- **Products Tracked:** ~3,500

### Monthly Revenue Estimate (at scale)

```
Assumptions:
- 100 visitors/day × 30 days = 3,000 visits/month
- 2% conversion rate = 60 conversions
- $125 average order value

Current Programs:
$125 AOV × 60 conversions = $7,500 GMV
× 6% average commission = $450/month

With Amazon + Additional Vendors:
+ $100-200/month (budget/beginner segment)
= $550-650/month total potential
```
