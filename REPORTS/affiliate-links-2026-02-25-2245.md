## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### 1. Missing Affiliate Links (3 Products)

| Product | Vendor | Reason | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| New Product | Unknown | No vendor identified | N/A |
| [GB]Finn 60XT Keyboard | — | Reddit group buy | Add vendor link if available |
| [GB] Float65 Keyboard | — | Reddit group buy | Add vendor link if available |

**Note:** Group buy posts from Reddit don't have direct affiliate links. These could be enhanced by linking to vendor GB pages when available.

---

## 💡 Link Opportunities

### Immediate Revenue Opportunities

**Group Buy Affiliate Links:**
- Finn 60XT Keyboard (ends March 30)
- Float65 Keyboard (ends March 25)
- **Action:** If these vendors (e.g., CannonKeys) have affiliate programs, add their GB page links with tracking

### Missing Vendor Integrations

Per `AFFILIATE-VENDORS.md`, these vendors have affiliate programs but are NOT integrated:

| Vendor | Commission | Priority | Products That Could Be Added |
|--------|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| CannonKeys | 5-8% | 🔴 High | Custom keyboards, GBs |
| Glorious | 5-10% | 🔴 High | GMMK keyboards, switches |
| The Key Company | 10% | 🔴 High | Keycaps, switches |
| DiviniKey | ~5% | 🟡 Medium | Entry/mid-range keyboards |
| Boardsource | 5-10% | 🟡 Medium | DIY kits |
| Ashkeebs (Canada) | ~5% | 🟢 Low | Canadian market |

### Estimation:
- Adding 6 new vendors at ~5-10% commission
- Estimated 200-400 additional products
- At 100-200 visitors/month converting 2%: **+$100-300/month potential**

---

## 📈 Revenue Impact

| Scenario | Monthly Revenue | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Previous (broken tracking)** | ~$50-100 | 1,300 links not attributed |
| **Current (fixed tracking)** | ~$150-300 | All links properly tracked |
| **+ New Vendors** | ~$300-500 | After adding CannonKeys, Glorious, TKC |

**The tracking fix could DOUBLE current affiliate revenue.**
