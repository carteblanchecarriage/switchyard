## Product Description Quality

### Empty Descriptions Count: 42 products (10.5% of catalog)

**Products missing descriptions:**
- Epomaker bundle products (keyboard + switch/keycap bundles) — 8 items
- Keycult hardware/parts (plates, PCBs, accessories) — 10 items  
- Novelkeys collaboration items — 6 items
- Assorted vendor bundle packages — 18 items

**Severity:** Medium
- Bundle products can use parent descriptions

**Quick Fix:** Copy description from parent product or category

## Critical HTML Issues

### 🔴 Issue #1: Image Placeholders in /best/index.html

**Locations:**
- Line ~95: Royal Kludge RK61
- Line ~131: Keychron Q3  
- Line ~166: Glorious GMMK Pro

**Status:** Still showing `[Image Placeholder]` text — **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Recommendation:**
1. Use product images from data.json
2. Create CSS placeholder with keyboard icon
3. Or remove image sections until assets available

### 🟡 Issue #2: HTML Syntax in /guides/switches/index.html

**Status:** Theme toggle button code visible in wrong location (reported Feb 25, needs verification fix)

---

## Cross-Sale Opportunities (Missed Revenue)

### Current State: POOR (2/10)

**Issues:**
- No internal linking between guides and products
- Keyboard cards missing "similar items" suggestions
- No "complete your setup" modules
- Switch guide doesn't link to keyboards that use those switches

**High-Value Opportunities:**

1. **Add "Related Products" to guide pages:**
   - /guides/switches/ → link to keyboards with hot-swap sockets
   - /guides/lubing/ → link to lube stations, brushes, switch pullers
   - /guides/complete/ → link to beginner keyboards under $100

2. **"Complete Your Setup" widgets on product cards:**
   - Keycaps matching the keyboard
   - Switch upgrade suggestions
   - Cable recommendations

3. **Comparison CTAs:**
   - "See all keyboards in this price range" links
   - "Compare with similar boards" buttons

**Estimated Revenue Impact:** +15-20% affiliate CTR with proper cross-selling

## Content Gaps & Suggestions

### /best/ Page — Needs Immediate Attention

**Current State:** 3 keyboard reviews, ~950 words
**Target:** 6-8 keyboard reviews, 2,500+ words

**Missing Sections:**
1. "How We Test" methodology (200 words) ✅ LOW PRIORITY
2. "Best for Gaming" expanded section (300 words) ⭐ HIGH
3. "Best for Typing/Office" section (300 words) ⭐ HIGH  
4. "Wireless vs Wired" comparison (200 words) ✅ MEDIUM
5. "What We Look For" buying guide (200 words) ⭐ HIGH
6. 3-5 more keyboard picks (600 words) ⭐ HIGH

**Quick Win:** Add budget gaming keyboard pick (~$90-120) and 65% layout recommendation

### /guides/complete/ — Minor Expansion

**Add:**
- "Common Beginner Mistakes" section (200 words)
- "Where to Buy" vendor comparison table (150 words)

---

## SEO Quick Wins

### Title Tags: ✅ GOOD
All pages have optimized title tags and meta descriptions

### Meta Descriptions:
- /guides/complete/ — 1.5 lines truncated in preview

JSON-LD structured data present on all guides

### Internal Linking Improvement:
**Current:** ~0 internal links between guides
**Target:** 3-5 relevant cross-links per page
