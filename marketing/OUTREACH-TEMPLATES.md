## Influencer Outreach

### YouTube Keyboard Reviewers

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Built a group buy tracker the keyboard community needed

Hi [Name],

I've been watching your channel since [specific video] and genuinely appreciate how you break down complex build concepts for the community. Your [specific video/topic] is the reason I finally understood [something about keyboards].

So – full transparency: I built Keebshelf (a group buy + in-stock tracker) for myself first because I couldn't keep up with Discord announcements. Now it's tracking 276 keyboards across 5 vendors with live updates every few hours.

**Why I'm reaching out:**
I think your audience would find value in having a single source for "what's actually available right now" rather than checking five different sites.

**What's in it for you:**
• Zero cost to feature it
• Affiliate links in the tool (I pay you if you want to use them)
• I'm happy to provide data insights (what's trending, what sold out, etc.)

**What I'm NOT asking for:**
No sponsored post, no obligation. If it doesn't fit your content, no worries at all.

**Quick link:** [keebshelf.com]

Would love 2 minutes of your feedback if you have time to check it out. If not, totally fine—keep making great content either way.

[Personal note about their recent content]

Thanks for your time,
Alex
```

**Follow-up Template (1 week later):**
```
Subject: Re: Group buy tracker for your audience

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on the Keebshelf tool I shared last week.

No pressure at all—I know you get tons of these requests. Just wanted to make sure it didn't get buried in your inbox.

If it's not a fit for your content, totally understand. If you do check it out and have any feedback (good or bad), I'd genuinely love to hear it.

Either way, appreciate what you do for the community.

Alex
```

### Tech/Gaming YouTubers

**Template:**
```
Subject: Tool for finding mechanical keyboards (not a sponsor pitch)

Hi [Name],

Noticed you featured [specific keyboard] in your recent video. One thing I consistently see in comments on keyboard videos: "Where do I buy this?"

I built Keebshelf as an answer to that question. It aggregates live inventory and group buys from major mechanical keyboard vendors so people can find what's actually in stock.

**Different from other sites:**
• Real-time data (scrapes vendor stores)
• Group buy tracking (shows what's upcoming)
• No account required
• Mobile-optimized

Link: [keebself.com]

Happy to give you a walkthrough if useful. Either way, thanks for the keyboard content—helped me build my first custom.

Alex
```

### Kono.store (Specific)

**Template:**
```
Subject: Data partnership – would help both our audiences

Hi Kono team,

I'm the creator of Keebshelf, a mechanical keyboard group buy tracker. Currently pulling from Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, and NovelKeys. Would love to add Kono.store.

**Current issue:** Your site returns 404s when I try to scrape via collections URL. Happy to adjust my scraper if you have a public API or preferred method.

**What's in it for you:**
• Increased visibility for your drops
• Additional traffic source
• We drive qualified buyers (not just browsers)

**Data we collect:**
• Product name, price, availability
• Category (keyboards, switches, etc.)
• Direct links (can include UTM tracking for you)

Open to API access or just guidance on respectful scraping (robots.txt compliant, rate limited).

Thanks,
Alex

## Community Engagement

### Reddit r/MechanicalKeyboards Post

2. "Built a group buy tracker since I kept missing ICs on Discord"

**276 items currently tracked:**

**Important:** There are affiliate links. Full transparency – if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

**What I'd really appreciate:**
• Is the data accurate?
• What vendor should I add next?

Built this for myself first, but figured the community might find it useful too.

Also working on comprehensive buyer's guides (beginner, switches, best budget customs).

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏
```

**Reddit Comment Template (when someone asks "where can I buy..."):**
```
I built a tool for this exact problem: [Keebshelf](link)

Aggregates real-time stock from Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack ICs. You can filter by vendor to see just [specific vendor] products or compare prices.

Has affiliate links (disclosed) but the data is legit – updates every few hours from actual vendor APIs.

[Optional: Add relevant context to question asked]
```

```

**Discord Server-Specific (Keychorn Server):**
```
Hi Keychron crew 👋

Built a tool that tracks Keychron keyboards (and 4 other vendors) in one place.

Live inventory from:
- Keychron official
- Drop
- KBDfans
- NovelKeys
- Geekhack interest checks

Features:
✅ Filter "just show me Keychron"
✅ Price sorting
✅ Mobile-friendly
✅ Updates every 2 hours

👉 https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/

Has affiliate links (coffee money if you buy). Free to use either way.

What other Keychron models should I prioritize?
```

### Twitter/X Thread Template (Launch)

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
I got tired of checking 5 different sites to find mechanical keyboard group buys.

So I built a dashboard that aggregates Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks in one place.

276 keyboards currently tracked. Auto-updates every few hours.

🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
The problem: Group buys get announced on Discord, Interest checks live in Google Docs, and in-stock alerts are vendor-specific.

You miss stuff. Or you have 20 tabs open comparing a Tofu60 to a Keychron Q1.

Keebshelf just shows what's actually available right now.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
Features I built because I needed them:

• Filter by vendor (just show me KBDfans)
• Price sorting (low to high)
• Sold-out items auto-hidden
• Mobile-friendly
• No signup required

Link: https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
Technical details: Static site, scraper runs on my homelab, pulls via Shopify APIs and web scraping, deploys to GitHub Pages.

Yes there are affiliate links. Full transparency: if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

Code is open. Data is live.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```
What's missing?

I'm manually curating Geekhack interest checks. Want to add Kono.store but their API is being weird.

If you have vendor suggestions or find broken links, reply here. Built this for myself first, but happy to make it useful for others.

RTs appreciated 🤙
```

### Hacker News Post

**Title:** "Show HN: I built a group buy tracker for mechanical keyboards"

**Body:**
```
I got tired of missing keyboard group buys because I forgot which Discord server announced them. Or finding out a board I wanted dropped yesterday and sold out.

Built Keebshelf: a single dashboard aggregating live inventory from Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks.

Currently tracking 276 items. Scrapes every few hours, filters out sold-out products, sorts by price/vendor/name.

Stack: Node.js scraper on a homelab, vanilla JS frontend, GitHub Pages hosting. Data served as static JSON.

Links are affiliate (full disclosure). No ads or tracking.

URL: https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/

Would love feedback on what other features would be useful. Plan to add email alerts for specific boards if there's interest.
```

## Press/PR Outreach

### Tech Blog Pitch

**Template:**
```
Subject: Story idea: Solving the "where do I buy this?" problem for mechanical keyboards

Hi [Editor],

Mechanical keyboards have gone from niche hobby to mainstream in the past few years. But there's a problem nobody's solved: finding what's actually in stock.

I built Keebshelf to aggregate real-time inventory across 5 major vendors (Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, Geekhack). It's effectively a "Hacker News for keyboards" but for in-stock items.

**Story angles:**
• Why group buys and in-stock keyboards are scattered across Discord and private forums
• How the mechanical keyboard community is fragmented
• The "build-vs-buy" dilemma and price transparency
• Open-source approach to e-commerce data

**Stats:**
• 276 keyboards tracked
• [X] monthly users
• Free, open scraper

Happy to provide quotes, data, or user testimonials.

Best,
Alex
