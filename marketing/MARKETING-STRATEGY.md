# Keebshelf Marketing Strategy

**Objective:** Launch Keebshelf to mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and drive 10,000 monthly organic visitors by Month 6.

**Timeline:** 3-phase launch strategy over 90 days

---

## Phase 1: Soft Launch (Days 1-30)

### Goal: Validate product-market fit with keyboard communities
**Target:** 500 unique users, 50 email subscribers

### Week 1: Build Anticipation
**Discord Outreach (Days 1-7)**

**Target Servers:**
1. r/MechanicalKeyboards Discord (48K members)
2. Keychron Discord (12K members)
3. Drop Community (18K members)
4. Keebtalk (invite-only, premium audience)
5. KBDfans Discord (8K members)

**Discord Launch Template:**
```
👋 Hey all – I've been building something that might be useful.

**Keebshelf** aggregates group buys and in-stock keyboards from Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks.

No more checking 5 sites to see what's available:
• Filter by vendor (just Drop products?)
• Sort by price (low to high)
• Mobile-friendly, no signup
• Auto-updates every few hours

🔗 https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/

Has affiliate links (full disclosure). If you click and buy, I might make enough for ☕.

Built it because **I was tired of missing group buy windows** announced on Discord and buried in vendor newsletters.

Feedback welcome – especially:
• What vendors should I add?
• What data would be useful?
• Bugs/broken links?

Thanks! 🎹
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Post on Monday/Wednesday/Friday evening (peak activity)
- Monitor for 48 hours, respond to every comment
- DM power users who show interest for testing feedback
- Track which servers drive most traffic (UTM codes)

### Week 2: Reddit Launch
**r/MechanicalKeyboards Post**

**Title:** "[GB] Keebshelf – A dashboard I built to track group buys across vendors"

**Body Template:**
```
I built this because I kept missing group buy windows and got tired of opening 8 tabs to compare entry-level customs.

**Aggregates live data from:**
• Keychron
• Drop  
• KBDfans
• NovelKeys
• Geekhack interest checks

**276 items currently tracked**
• Filters by category (keyboards, switches, cases, keycaps)
• Sorts by price, vendor, or name
• Hides sold-out items automatically
• Updates every few hours via scraper

🔗 [keebshelf.com](https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/)

**Technical details:**
• Static site (GitHub Pages)
• Node.js scraper (my homelab)
• Pulls from Shopify APIs + web scraping
• No signup required
• Mobile-optimized

**Important:** There are affiliate links. Full transparency – if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

**What I'd really appreciate:**
• Is the data accurate?
• What vendor should I add next?
• Any broken links?
• What features would make this truly useful?

Built this for myself first, but figured the community might find it useful too.

Also working on comprehensive buyer's guides (beginner, switches, best budget customs).

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏
```

**Post Timing:**
- **Best:** Sunday 2-4 PM EST (when US/EU are both active)
- **Avoid:** Friday nights, major GH IC drops
- **Cross-post:** r/Keychron (12K), r/BudgetKeebs (3K)

### Week 3: Twitter/X Thread
**Tweet Structure:**

**Tweet 1/5:** Hook
```
I got tired of checking 5 different sites to find mechanical keyboard group buys.

So I built a dashboard that aggregates Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks in one place.

276 keyboards currently tracked. Auto-updates every few hours.

🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2/5:** Problem
```
The problem: Group buys get announced on Discord, Interest checks live in Google Docs, and in-stock alerts are vendor-specific.

You miss stuff. Or you have 20 tabs open comparing a Tofu60 to a Keychron Q1.

Keebshelf just shows what's actually available right now.
```

**Tweet 3/5:** Features
```
Features I built because I needed them:

• Filter by vendor (just show me KBDfans)
• Price sorting (low to high)
• Sold-out items auto-hidden
• Mobile-friendly
• No signup required

👉 https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/
```

**Tweet 4/5:** Trust
```
Technical details: Static site, scraper runs on my homelab, pulls via Shopify APIs and web scraping, deploys to GitHub Pages.

Yes there are affiliate links. Full transparency: if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

Code is open. Data is live.
```

**Tweet 5/5:** Ask
```
What's missing?

I'm manually curating Geekhack interest checks. Want to add Kono.store but their API is being weird.

If you have vendor suggestions or find broken links, reply here.

Built this for myself first, but happy to make it useful for others.

RTs appreciated 🤙

Subject: Keebshelf - A Group Buy Aggregator I Built For Our Community

Hi [Name],

I've been following your channel for [specific reason - e.g., "love your switch sound comparisons"]. You're the reason I got into mechanical keyboards.

I built something you might find useful: Keebshelf ([link]) aggregates live group buys and in-stock keyboards from major vendors (Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, Geekhack).

Currently tracking 276 items with auto-updates.

**Why you might care:**
• Free tool for your audience
• Data-driven (not sponsored by vendors)
• Live inventory (not manual lists)

Could I send you beta access or get your feedback? No obligations, just thought your viewers would find it useful.

P.S. [Personal note about their content]

Thanks for all the content you create.

Alex

## Risk Mitigation

**What if Reddit post gets downvoted?**
- Delete and repost with modified content
- Ask in community thread "What do you think of this?" instead of direct promo
- Focus on Discord engagement instead

**What if vendors complain about scraping?**
- Have robots.txt explanation ready
- Offer to optimize their SEO/direct traffic
- Offer data partnership (we send them traffic, they give us API access)
- Worst case: Remove vendor and move on

**What if affiliate links are flagged?**
- Disclose prominently
- Lead with value, not sales
- Make tool useful without clicking links

**What if we run out of growth ideas?**
- Survey existing users
- Analyze competitor strategies
- Expand to adjacent niches (gaming peripherals, office tech)
