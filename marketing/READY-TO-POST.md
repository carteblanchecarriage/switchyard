- Sold-out items hidden by default
- Mobile-friendly, no account required

**Vendors currently tracked:**
Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, Epomaker, plus Geekhack interest checks

- Node.js scraper on my homelab
- Vanilla JS frontend

## TWITTER/X THREADS

### Launch Thread (5 Tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
I got tired of checking 5 different sites to find mechanical keyboard group buys.

So I built a dashboard that aggregates Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack in one place.

376 keyboards tracked. Auto-updates every 2 hours.

Thread 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Group buys get announced on Discord, interest checks live in Google Docs, and in-stock alerts are vendor-specific.

You miss stuff. Or you have 20 tabs open comparing a Tofu60 to a Keychron Q1.

Keebshelf just shows what's actually available right now.

---

**Tweet 3:**
Features I built because I needed them:

• Filter by vendor (just show me KBDfans)
• Price sorting (low to high)
• Sold-out items auto-hidden
• Mobile-friendly
• No signup required

Tech details: Static site, Node.js scraper on homelab, pulls via Shopify APIs and web scraping.

Yes there are affiliate links. Full transparency: if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

Code is open. Data is live.

**Tweet 5:**
What's missing?

• Kono.store (API is being weird)
• More Geekhack interest checks
• Email alerts (coming if people want it)

If you have vendor suggestions or find broken links, reply here.

Built this for myself first, but happy to make it useful for others.

RTs appreciated 🤙

### First Comment (as maker):
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Built Keebshelf because I hate missing group buy windows. I'm a mechanical keyboard hobbyist and was checking 5+ vendor sites daily. Got annoying.

Current stats:
- 376 items tracked
- Updates every 2 hours
- 6 vendors + Geekhack ICs

What I'd love feedback on:
- What vendors should I add?
- Is anyone interested in email alerts?
- Any broken links I missed?

Happy to answer questions about the scraping setup or why mechanical keyboards are an expensive hobby 🙃

- Alex (solo dev, keyboard nerd)

## BLOG POST SNIPPETS

### Launch Post Intro:
```
I missed my third group buy window last month.

Not because I didn't want the keyboard—I just didn't see the announcement. It was buried in Discord somewhere, or maybe in an email I archived.

So I built Keebshelf: a dashboard that shows live group buys across all major vendors in one place.

Here's how it works...
```

### "My First Build" Hook:
```
I built my first custom mechanical keyboard last year.

Total cost: $847
Expected cost: $300

Here's where all that money went, and what I wish I'd known before starting...
```

## REPLY TEMPLATES (Common Questions)

### "How do you make money?"
```
Affiliate commissions. If you click a link and buy something, I get a small percentage (3-10%).

Doesn't cost you anything extra. Full transparency though—if you'd rather not use my links, you can navigate to the vendor directly.

If this gets traction, I might add a Patreon or voluntary payment option. But right now it's just coffee money.
```

### "Is this legal?"
```
Yes—I'm scraping public data that anyone can access by visiting the vendors' websites. The same way Google, price comparison sites, and search engines work.

I don't bypass any security, don't scrape behind login walls, and respect robots.txt.

That said, if any vendor asks me to stop, I'll remove them immediately.
```

### "Add [vendor]?"
```
Great suggestion! I'll look into adding them.

Some vendors are harder to scrape than others (looking at you, Kono.store with your weird API), but I'll add it to the list.

[If you have a contact there, feel free to intro me!]
```

### "What about email alerts?"
```
This is the #1 requested feature. I'm working on it!

Planning to add:
- Email alerts for price drops
- Restock notifications
- New product announcements

If you want to be notified when this launches, [add email capture method here]
```

### "Is there a mobile app?"
```
Not yet! The website is mobile-responsive though, so it works on phones.

If there's enough interest, I could build an app, but right now I'm focusing on the web experience.
```

### Bug Report Response:
```
Thanks for the bug report! Can you share:
- What browser/device you're using?
- What you clicked before it broke?
- What you expected vs what happened?

I'll look into it ASAP.
```
