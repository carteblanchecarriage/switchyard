                <div class="blog-meta">
                    Published February 27, 2026 | 12 min read | Switch Analysis
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Something happened in late 2023 that shook up the mechanical keyboard world. Cherry — yes, <em>the</em> Cherry, the company that invented the MX switch in 1983 and dominated the mechanical keyboard market for decades — <strong>retooled their entire switch lineup</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The result is <strong>Cherry MX2A</strong>. New molds. New materials. New factory. New everything. But after 40 years of manufacturing, why change? And more importantly: <em>is the new Cherry actually any better?</em>
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cherry MX2A is noticeably smoother than the original, with reduced spring ping and improved consistency. Is it "better"? Yes, objectively. Is it worth switching from your current favorite? Only if you're not happy with your current Cherry switches. The real question isn't "Original vs MX2A" — it's "why pay Cherry prices when Gateron and Kailh exist?"
            </div>

            <h2>The Original Problem: Cherry MX's Fall From Grace</h2>

            <p>
                Back in the 1980s and 90s, Cherry MX switches were <em>the</em> benchmark. Every gaming keyboard used Cherry MX Blues (clicky) or Reds (linear). Every enthusiast build started with Cherry switches. Cherry was synonymous with mechanical keyboards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then something changed. Around 2010-2015, Cherry's quality became... inconsistent. Spring ping. Scratchy sliders. Inconsistent actuation. The switches that built the mechanical keyboard industry started feeling like they were built on a Monday morning by someone who wanted to be somewhere else.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers like Gateron and Kailh started catching up. By 2018, Gateron Yellows — buttery smooth, affordable, consistent — were outselling Cherry in the enthusiast market. By 2020, Kailh Box switches — with their dust-proof design and unique feel — were in premium builds. Cherry was losing relevance.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Cherry Retooled: The MX2A Update</h2>

            <p>
                The MX2A update wasn't a minor revision. Cherry basically rebuilt their manufacturing from scratch. Here's what actually changed:
            </p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Component</th>
                        <th>Original Cherry MX</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Spring</strong></td>
                        <td>Standard spring with varying QC, noticeable ping</td>
                        <td>New "Hyperglide" spring with pre-lube and better consistency</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Slider/Housing</strong>></td>

                        <td><strong>Factory Lubrication</strong></td>
                        <td>Minimal or inconsistent</td>
                        <td>Light factory lube on all MX2A switches</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Consistency</strong></td>
                        <td>High variance batch-to-batch, "Cherry lottery"</td>
                        <td>Much tighter tolerances, more consistent feel</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Actuation Force</strong></td>
                        <td>Variable (some too heavy, some too light)</td>
                        <td>Tighter spec tolerance, closer to rated values</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Side-by-Side: Original vs MX2A Feel</h2>

            <p>
                I tested identical boards with Cherry MX Red Original vs MX2A Reds. Same keycaps. Same plate. Same case. Here's the subjective comparison:
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box blue">
                <strong><span class="switch-type switch-linear">RED/BLACK</span> Linear Switches:</strong>
                <br><br>
                • <strong>Original:</strong> Slight scratchiness on downstroke, noticeable spring ping when typing fast, some switches smoother than others (the "lottery")<br>
                • <strong>MX2A:</strong> Significantly smoother — comparable to lubed Gateron Yellows. Spring ping is almost gone. Much more consistent switch-to-switch.<br><br>
                <strong>Winner: MX2A (clear improvement)</strong>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong><span class="switch-type switch-tactile">BROWN</span> Tactile Switches:</strong>
                <br><br>
                • <strong>Original:>/strong> "Scratchy" tactile bump, can feel gritty, inconsistent bump position<br>
                • <strong>MX2A:</strong> Smoother bump, more defined actuation, less "sand in the switch" feeling<br><br>
                <strong>Winner: MX2A (modest improvement)</strong>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong><span class="switch-type switch-clicky">BLUE</span> Clicky Switches:</strong>
                <br><br>
                • <strong>Original:</strong> Classic high-pitched click, can be rattly, inconsistent click volume<br>
                • <strong>MX2A:</strong> Click is slightly more refined, less rattle, but still very "Cherry MX Blue" in character<br><br>
                <strong>Winner: Tie (if you like MX Blues, you'll like MX2A Blues)</strong>
            </div>

            <h2>The Real Competition: Cherry vs Gateron vs Kailh</h2>

            <p>
                Here's where it gets interesting. Cherry improved, but so did everyone else. Let's compare Cherry MX2A to the switches people actually buy in 2026:
            </p>

                        <td><strong>Gateron Oil King</strong></td>
                        <td>~$35-45</td>

                        <td>Premium budget option, pre-lubed</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                <strong>The verdict:</strong> Cherry MX2A is competitive again. It's smooth, consistent, and finally lives up to the reputation. But it's also 2-3x the price of Gateron Yellows which are objectively smoother. You're paying for the name and the "Cherry feel" which some people genuinely prefer.

            <h2>Availability: Can You Still Buy Original Cherry?</h2>

            <p>
                This is the confusing part. As of 2024-2025, most major keyboard manufacturers (Leopold, Filco, Das Keyboard, etc.) switched to MX2A. You can still find original Cherry MX switches in:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Old stock on Amazon/Newegg (check manufacture dates)</li>
                <li>Some budget brands that bought bulk before the switch</li>
                <li>Individual switch sellers on r/mechmarket</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But honestly? <strong>You shouldn't want original Cherry anymore.</strong> Unless you have a specific vintage board or nostalgia for the scratchy feel, MX2A is superior in every measurable way. The only reason to seek original Cherry is if you genuinely prefer that "classic" feel — and even then, you might find you're misremembering how good they actually were.

                    <li>You're building a board and specifically want Cherry switches</li>
                    <li>You prefer the Cherry "character" (slightly heavier, more feedback)</li>
                    <li>You're replacing switches in a pre-built that came with MX2A</li>
                    <li>You want the warranty/support of buying genuine Cherry</li>
                    <li>You're nostalgic for Cherry but want better quality</li>

                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">

                    <li>You want dust-proof switches (Kailh Box wins here)</li>
                    <li>You're comparing to lubed switches (lubed Gateron beats stock MX2A)</li>
                    <li>The keyboard brand charges a huge premium for "Cherry MX" branding</li>

            <p>
                Most reputable switch vendors now carry MX2A. Look for "MX2A" explicitly in the listing — if it just says "Cherry MX," you might get old stock. For pre-built keyboards, check the manufacturer website or ask customer service which Cherry switches they use.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Verdict: Cherry's Comeback</h2>

            <p>
                Cherry MX2A is a genuine improvement. The new manufacturing process fixed the consistency issues that plagued Cherry for 10+ years. Spring ping is reduced, smoothness is improved, and the switches finally feel like they should for the price.
            </p>

            <p>
                But here's the truth: the mechanical keyboard world moved on during Cherry's decline. Gateron, Kailh, and Akko raised the bar. MX2A brings Cherry back to competitive status, but it doesn't blow past the competition. It's <em>good</em> now, not <em>great</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The 2026 Reality Check:</strong> If you're choosing between Cherry MX2A and Gateron Yellows, and they're the same price, Cherry wins on preference and "character." But Gateron Yellows are half the price. So unless you specifically want that Cherry feel, your money goes further elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cherry MX2A is for people who want Cherry. And now, at least, Cherry is worth wanting again.
