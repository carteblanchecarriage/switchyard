# Keebshelf Launch Posts

## Twitter/X Thread (5 tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
I got tired of checking 5 different sites to find mechanical keyboard group buys.

So I built a dashboard that aggregates Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks in one place.

276 keyboards currently tracked. Auto-updates every few hours.

The problem: Group buys get announced on Discord, Interest checks live in Google Docs, and in-stock alerts are vendor-specific.

You miss stuff. Or you have 20 tabs open comparing a Tofu60 to a Keychron Q1.

Keebshelf just shows what's actually available right now.

Features I built because I needed them:

• Filter by vendor (just show me KBDfans)
• Price sorting (low to high)
• Sold-out items auto-hidden
• Mobile-friendly
• No signup required

Technical details: Static site, scraper runs on my homelab, pulls via Shopify APIs and web scraping, deploys to GitHub Pages.

Yes there are affiliate links. Full transparency: if you buy through one, I get coffee money.

Code is open. Data is live.

What's missing?

I'm manually curating Geekhack interest checks. Want to add Kono.store but their API is being weird.

If you have vendor suggestions or find broken links, reply here. Built this for myself first, but happy to make it useful for others.

RTs appreciated 🤙

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: I built a group buy tracker for mechanical keyboards

**Body:**
I got tired of missing keyboard group buys because I forgot which Discord server announced them. Or finding out a board I wanted dropped yesterday and sold out.

Built Keebshelf: a single dashboard aggregating live inventory from Keychron, Drop, KBDfans, NovelKeys, and Geekhack interest checks.

Currently tracking 276 items. Scrapes every few hours, filters out sold-out products, sorts by price/vendor/name.

Stack: Node.js scraper on a homelab, vanilla JS frontend, GitHub Pages hosting. Data served as static JSON.

Links are affiliate (full disclosure). No ads or tracking.

URL: https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/

Would love feedback on what other features would be useful. Plan to add email alerts for specific boards if there's interest.

## Reddit r/MechanicalKeyboards Post

**Title:** [GB] Keebshelf – A dashboard for tracking group buys across vendors

**Body:**
I built this because I kept missing group buy windows and got tired of opening 8 tabs to compare entry-level customs.

Aggregates live data from:
• Keychron
• Drop  
• KBDfans
• NovelKeys
• Geekhack interest checks

276 items currently. Filters by category, sorts by price, hides sold-out stuff.

https://carteblanchecarriage.github.io/keebshelf/dashboard/

It's just a static site pulling JSON. No signup, works on mobile. If you click an affiliate link and buy something, I might make enough for coffee.

Feedback welcome – especially if you know of vendors I should add or features that would actually be useful.
